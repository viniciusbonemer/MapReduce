# MapReduce

This is a project developed during a course in distributed systems. The main goal was to implement a distributed version of the word count problem (counting how many times each word is repeated in a document) and to test its performance. 
This code was designed to run in a very specific scenario and with short term goals, so there are many improvements that could be made especially in relation to supporting classes such as `ConnectionTester`s, which were just copied from one project to another with ad hoc adaptations. 
The report present in the repository explains the project in more detail as well as the conclusions from the tests.
